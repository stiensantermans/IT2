      <h2>Antwerp Life</h2>
			<h4>Gepost op 3 februari 2016</h4>
			<p>When I started studying in Antwerp, I decided to rent a room. My love for the city has grown unconditionally, hower I must tell you what a big diffrence it is with my hometown, Hasselt. Read about my experience in the article</p>
			<br>
			<p>First of all, I think Antwerp is one of the most beautiful cities in Belgium, so living there is amazing. However the cultural diffrence between Antwerp en Hasselt is big. Antwerp is the city of fashion and the city that actually
				dares to wear that fashion and I love it. There are lots of little cosy coffee shops and unique boutiques in Antwerp, something I miss in Hasselt. But Hasselt has recently been developing the city with campaigns, new buildings and
				restaurations. The new Ikea, Sissy Boy, Kiko Milano and Primark are good examples. However, it will never be as good as a shopping day in the Antwerp streets. What I love about Hasselt is that it is so cosy. There are many open
				places filled with people talking to each other and cosy little bars where you can drink something at night. I also miss going out in Hasselt, because I knew everybody and always went to the same club because I loved the music so
				much there. In Antwerp, there are also many places to go out, but they're all filled with the same sort music and are spread over the whole city. In Hasselt, you can just walk out in one club and go in another one. I must confess,
				I don't go out so often in Antwerp because of the school work. I'd rather go to a cosy coffee shop where I can drink something with my friends.
