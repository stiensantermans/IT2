			<h2>NYC Streets</h2>
			<h4>Gepost op 4 februari 2016</h4>
			<p>Do you want to know what to visit when you travel to the big apple? You can find my personal travel guide below. However I will only be talking about Manhattan. Read about my fav places and spots in the article</p>
			<br>
			<p> First of all, whenever you get the chance to visit New York: do it! It is such a beautiful city with many multicultural influences. New York is devided in diffrent pieces. Manhattan is the best known example of that.
				 	In Manhattan you can find the Empire State Building, the 9/11 Memorial, China Town, Soho, Central Park and lots of other famous places. My personal favorite was 'Top of the Rock': there is a view all over the city as you can
					see in the picture. I also recommend the night tour on the Brooklyn Bridge, there is nothing more beautiful in the world than the view of the Manhattan skyline by night. If you like to keep up with the Kardashians, you can
					visit one of their fav stores: Dash. </p>
			<p> Foodies can find their place in Downtown Manhattan, where you can find Obama's favourite restaurant. Breakfasts are most likey to be eaten in 24/7 restaurants or Starbucks.
