			<h2>Photography</h2>
			<h4>Gepost op 1 februari 2016</h4>
			<p>I always have been interested in photography. When I was 14 years old, I decided to go to an Art School to study photography and videography. And I must tell you, it changed my life. Read my story in the article</p>
			<br>
			<p> When I was 12 years old, I already told my mother I wanted to be a photographer or work as an art-director. In the years that followed, I let go of my dream because I didn't believe I would actually make it. Three
					years later, I wasn't happy with the choises I made. I felt like an outsider. My twin brother was in that time also interested in art and already went to an art school. So I decided to follow him.
					The first day I walked in that school, I knew I was in the right place. I felt like I could be myself again and do what I loved to do. Since that day, I learned to not let go on my dreams. I still have that same
					dream and I will make it. I think Art School has made me to who I am now. I'm really thankful and met a lot of great people. Most of them are still my best friends, because we have the same passion and dreams.
					Having a goal in your life is one of the most important things to me. Because if you don't, you don't have much to live for. And even if you don't make it to that one big goal, know that you already have
					accomplished a lot of minor goals. And p.s. all pictures on the blog are mine!</p>
